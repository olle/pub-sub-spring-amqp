Pub/Sub Examples
================

In order to show how the Pub/Sub library works, and provide developers with
a setup to get some hands-on experience, we've provided a small example setup.

Running the examples
--------------------

1. Start the RabbitMQ server container by running `make` in this directory.

2. Open both the `pub/` and `sub/` directories in a terminal window, next to
   each other.

3. Each of the example _sides_ can be started by simply running `make`.
